Project uses and analyses a variety of time series models on various datasets. Methods like ARIMA modelling, co-integration, and the method of moments are used to predict and understand stochastic variance in data. 

Project is fully documented in [the project notes](201605543MATH5315.pdf). A fully functional code implementation in notes is included in [the markdown file.](src/Main.rmd)
